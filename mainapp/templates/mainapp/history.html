                mobilizing acumen and deep community service acts of her late father, Engineer Okore Booker Charles, OBC. He 
                dedicated his life to fixing challenges, using his personal resources to support family, neighbours, friends, 
                the community and strangers whenever he got the opportunity. He valued education, politics, farming, environmental 
                preservation and human rights.{% endblocktrans %}

                He was an ardent believer in the law as an instrument of seeking justice and achieving balance in the society. 
                He constantly stepped in to oversee his friends' projects and manage teams on their behalf whenever they were away 
                on international engagements, having resigned on a voluntary basis to dedicate his life to service.{% endblocktrans %}

                support each other and build relationships.{% endblocktrans %}

                that resulted in his family receiving valuable support throughout his sickness, final demise and graceful send off. From this, 
                the organization draws the value of networking, collaboration and cooperation in building functional ecosystems for individuals, 
                groups and organizations.{% endblocktrans %}
