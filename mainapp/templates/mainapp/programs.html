                The OBC Volunteer program is ideal for healthcare students and practitioners and aims to place
                enthusiastic volunteers in the right spaces to make a positive impact on the lives of the
                underserved people in the region. These volunteers get to help out in local medical clinics,
                dispensaries, and hospitals and assist in clinical work.

                We also offer placement for volunteers who are interested in working with children in different
                capacities. Some of the ways to do this is through participating in School Development
                Assistance through teaching, child care and companionship and classroom construction.
                Volunteers work with parents, local teachers and caregivers to improve the existing educational
                style by creating a rich and indigenous curriculum.

            Due to the rich farming community in Kenya, eco farming volunteering is highly encouraged for
            individuals who are concerned about sustainability, climate change and community farming.
            They get to connect with the local farming communities and share their skills to enhance the
            farming standards and contribute to food security. We give our volunteers a detailed overview of
            ELAN Domes' volunteer mission and expectations to enable them to be confident and
            knowledgeable about the causes they are undertaking and to cultivate the motivation and
            enthusiasm that encouraged them to volunteer in the first place.
